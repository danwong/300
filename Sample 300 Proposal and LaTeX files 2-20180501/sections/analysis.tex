\subsection{Conclusions of Analysis}
To summarize the conclusions of the prior analysis, the "emotional contagion" experiment conducted by Facebook researchers was in violation of tenets 1.04 and 2.03 of the Software Engineering Code of Ethics, but was in compliance with tenet 2.05.  The researchers had sufficient evidence for potential risks of anxiety to participants, and were required to make those risks known to the participants according to tenet 1.04.  Because participation in the study was not made known to the participants, they could not have been aware of these risks.  In addition, this lack of notification shows that the participants could not have given official approval for the use of their data in the experiment, as required by tenet 2.03.  Though Facebook claims the Data Use Policy is sufficient for gathering this approval, the document did not mention research until four months after the study, and therefore could not have gathered official approval at the time of the experiment.  Finally, because the posts were analyzed by software and were not seen by the researchers, the privacy of confidential information (users' posts) was maintained in accordance with tenet 2.05.  As no assessment was made of the data, there could not have been justification for disclosure according to the welfare of the general public or the law.
