\section{EXTERNAL ARGUMENTS}
\subsection{Encryption: Last Week Tonight with John Oliver (HBO)}
In an influential piece by John Oliver, he argues that whatever happens in this case will have huge rammifications. "Because, the FBI ultimately wants Apple and the entire technology industry to have an encryption always be weak enough that the company can access customer's data if law enforcement needs it." \cite{John-Oliver}.

\subsection{Matt Blaze: A key under the doormat isn't safe. Neither is an encryption backdoor.}
Matt Blaze, an associate professor in the Computer Science Department at the University of Pennsylvania, "studies secure systems cryptography and the impact of technology on public policy." In 1993, the "Clipper Chip" was invented by the NSA and was as a device that would encrypt consumer computer's data but allow officials to access the data if needed. However, Matt Blaze was able to exploit the security flaws in the system. "Clipper's failure starkly demonstrated that cryptographic backdoors must be understood first as a technical problem... Clipper failed not because the NSA was incompetent, but because desigining a system with a backdoor was - and still is - fundamentally in conflict with basic security principles." \cite{Washington-Blaze}

\subsection{Manhattan District Attorney: Smartphone Encryption and Public Safety}
The Manhattan District Attorney's office believes that Apple and technology companies alike are making encryption decisions based on their business interests rather than considering the public's safety interests. "Without legislative action, these corporations will 'continue' to focus on customer and shareholder value,' while government entities 'will try to demonstrate the critical public safety price they (meaning we) pay for 'warrant-proof' platforms'." \cite{Manhattan-da}

\subsection{Tal Yarkoni: In Defense of Facebook}
The US Code of Federal Regulations also specifies conditions for waiving the requirements of informed consent that protect the welfare of participants \cite{csrwaive}.  Tal Yarkoni argues that the study satisfies these conditions primarily because of the insignificance and ambiguity of resulting effects \cite{defense} and that the manipulation was “not different from ordinary experience” \cite{defensedefense}.

\subsection{Zeynep Tufekci: Facebook and Engineering the Public}
Zeynep Tufekci expresses concern over Yarkoni's argument and its defense of the status quo, stressing the responsibility of the academic community to "speak up in spite of corporate or government interests" \cite{engineering}.

\subsection{Michelle N. Meyer: Misjudgements will drive social trials underground}
In agreement with Yarkoni, Michelle Meyer highlights the preexisting manipulative nature of Facebook's news feed algorithms.  She questions whether the experiment posed any significant risk to participants and whether the results conclusively demonstrate an increase in negative emotions.  Finally, she warns of the potential consequences of outrage against the experiment \cite{misjudgements}.
