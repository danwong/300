\section{HOW THE SOFTWARE ENGINEERING CODE OF ETHICS APPLIES}\
The IEEE/ACM Softwar Engineering Code of Ethics considers software engineers to be those who "contribute by direct participation ... to the analysis, specification, design, development, ... and testing of software systems." \cite{code}
The operating system is the essential piece of software which interfaces between the user and hardware. "An operating system is a software which performs all the basic tasks like file management, (and) memory management" \cite{tutorialspoint}\par

Thus, the employees at Apple whom are tasked with creating and maintaining critical safety features on the operating system are considered Software Engineers. These employees "shall adhere to the [Software Engineering] Code of Ethics and Professional Practice" \cite{code}
Software Engineers at Apple are the ones responsible for creating the operating system that fully encrypts and protects the data stored on iPhones from becoming breached. The IEE/ACM Software Engineering Code of Ethics states that "Because of their roles in developing software systems, software engineers have significant opportunities to do good or cause harm, to enable others to do good or cause harm." \cite{code} Is Apple instructing their software engineers to do good or cause harm? \par
