\section{HOW THE SOFTWARE ENGINEERING CODE OF ETHICS APPLIES}
The IEEE/ACM Software Engineering Code of Ethics defines software engineers as individuals "who contribute by direct participation ... to the ... development ... and testing of software systems" \cite{code}.  Are the researchers behind Facebook's "emotional contagion" study software engineers according to this definition? \par
The Facebook news feed is "software that delivers personalized streams of content" \cite{define-news-feed}.
According to the "emotional contagion" paper, the experiment included the manipulation of an algorithm that filters user content on the news feed:
"Which content is shown or omitted in the News Feed is determined via a ranking algorithm that Facebook continually \textit{develops and tests} ... One such test is reported in this study" \cite{study}. \par
Because the experimenters contributed to the development and testing of the Facebook news feed algorithm, a software system, they can be considered software engineers who "shall adhere to the [Software Engineering] Code of Ethics and Professional Practice" \cite{code}.
